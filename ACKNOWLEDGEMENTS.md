# Acknowledgements

This project could not have been possible without the help of the following resources:

- [OSDev.org](https://wiki.osdev.org/Expanded_Main_Page) has been really helpful to get me started.
- The [`x86_64`](https://crates.io/crates/x86_64) crate (though not directly used in this project)
  has been used as reference when implementing some of the x86_64-specific logic.

- The [Internals of XOK/ExoS](https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/archive/exo/exo-internals/internals.html)
