# Acknowledgements

This project could not have been possible without the help of the following resources:

- [OSDev.org](https://wiki.osdev.org/Expanded_Main_Page) has been really helpful to get me started.
- The [`x86_64`](https://crates.io/crates/x86_64) crate (though not directly used in this project)
  has been used as reference when implementing some of the x86_64-specific logic.
- This [Exokernel: An Operating System Architecture for Application-Level Resource Management](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~kubitron/cs262/handouts/papers/engler95exokernel.pdf)
  on Exokernel design by Dawson R. Engler, M. Frans Kaashoek, and James O'Toole Jr.
- The [Internals of XOK/ExoS](https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/archive/exo/exo-internals/internals.html)
  were a blessing when trying to wrap my head around the concrete implementation of the XOK
  exokernel.
- [Fast and Flexible Application-Level Networking on Exokernel Systems](https://web.stanford.edu/~engler/exo-tocs.pdf)
  by Gregory R. Ganger, Dawson R. Engler M. Frans Kaashoek, Hector Brice~no, Russell Hunt, Thomas
  Pinckney.
