# x86_64 System Calls

On x86_64, system calls are performed using the `syscall` instruction. The system call number is
passed in the `rax` register, and the arguments are passed to `rdi`, `rsi` and `rdx`.

The return value is stored in `rax`.

| Mnemonic                | `rax` | `rdi`   | `rsi` | `rdx` |
| ----------------------- | ----- | ------- | ----- | ----- |
| [ring0](#ring0)         | 0     | data    | f     |       |
| [terminate](#terminate) | 1     | process |       |       |

## Type Definitions

```c
typedef uint64_t SysResult;
typedef uint64_t ProcessHandle;
```

## ring0

```c
SysResult ring0(void *data, void (*f)(void *data));
```

The `ring0` system call is used to execute a function in ring 0.

The provided `data` parameter is passed to `f` as its unique argument. The provided function is
guarenteed to be executed at most once.

Note that none of the parameters of this system call are validated by the kernel. Specifically, `f`
can point to any address and the kernel will still attempt to execute it.

### Returns

This function always return `0` on success.

## terminate

```c
SysResult terminate(ProcessHandle process);
```

The `terminate` system call terminates the specified process.

If the provided parameter is `0`, the current process is terminated and the system call never
returns control to the caller.

### Returns

This system call always returns `0` on success, or never if the specified process is the current
one.
